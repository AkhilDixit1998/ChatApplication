to change and introduce new features, the appreciation of existing features and functions is necessary. To have a basic understanding 
of the working of messaging applications and to have an in depth knowledge regarding it is the sole purpose of this project.

Technology and Library:
This project is created for android platform and uses google firebase as the storage for chats,files and images.The chats are not stored
on the local device and so the application can only be run while online.

Features:
This chatting application provides a very convenient way of sending private chat messages. Even when the other person is not online 
you can drop a message and as soon as they come online the message would be delivered to them. Even if there is some network problem 
on your side once the sent button is clicked it would conveniently wait for optimum network connectivity. Sending and uploading personal
files and data can be easily done.
